# **_Fishing_game_**

### **_Building a fishing game in JavaScript is a great way to practice core game development concepts like animation loops, collision detection, and user input. The simplest way to create the visual elements is with the HTML <canvas> element and its 2D rendering context._**

**_The core components of the game will be:_**

- **_HTML: The structure of the game, including the <canvas> element, a score display, and an instruction area._**
- **_CSS: The styling for the game's layout._**
- **_JavaScript: The game logic, which handles drawing, player movement, fish AI, collision detection, and scoring._**
  
Basic game logic overview

- Initialize the Canvas: Get a reference to the <canvas> element and its 2D context.
- Handle User Input: Listen for mouse or keyboard events to control the fishing hook.
- Create Game Objects: Use JavaScript classes or objects to represent game elements like the player's hook and various types of fish.
- Create the Game Loop: Use requestAnimationFrame() to create a game loop that continuously clears the canvas, updates object positions, and redraws them.
- Implement Collision Detection: Write a function to check for collisions between the fishing hook and the fish.
- Manage Game State: Keep track of the score, game over conditions, and other game variables.
